ESP32-S3 BadUSB Proof-of-Concept

A proof-of-concept BadUSB project using the ESP32-S3 DevKitC. It demonstrates HID (Human Interface Device) emulation, keystroke injection, and custom payload deployment for security research, red teaming, and penetration testing.

This project includes a web-based control panel for the ESP32-S3 BadUSB, enabling users to upload, edit, and execute BadUSB scripts directly from a browser over WiFi.

## File Structure:
`/languages` (inside of sd card, containing all Language files, You need to find the Language files yourself. Putting them here in the repository would get me into legal trouble. You need to create them yourself)
  en.json 
  de.json

`/DESIGNS` (inside of the sd card, containing the `/CSS`, `/JSS`, and `/FONTS` folders. You need to create them yourself)
  .....

`index.html` (inside of the sd card, containing the Website. Copy/Paste the [`index.html`](https://github.com/QWavey/ESP-32-S3-devkitc-BadUSB/edit/main/index.html)

## 🗂️ Planned File Structure

- `index.html` → main frontend (UI for writing & executing scripts)
- `syntaxes.json` → list of all available commands (`STRING`, `DELAY`, `REPEAT`, etc.) with description + examples
- `main.cpp` (firmware) → ESP32 BadUSB logic
- `README.md` → project documentation (this file)
- Folder for payloads `/payloads` ✅
- Folder for Fonts `/FONTS` ✅ (not working correctly tho)
- Folder for custom Designs / Items such as CSS, JS, HTML. `/items`
- `/languages` (inside of sd card, containing all files) ✅
- `config.json` (inside of the Root of the SD card. Main config for WiFi hosting, password etc  etc....)
- `/uploads` For saving uploaded files ✅

## ⏳ Work in Progress Wiki

- To see the incomplete structure, go to : [Wiki](https://github.com/XQuantumWaveX/ESP-32-S3-devkitc-BadUSB/wiki)
---

## ⌛ Next Steps

1. Integrate an `syntaxes.json` to integrate all commands
2. Define full JSON schema for supported commands
3. Add status indicators in UI for working / not working features
4. Gradually implement missing features 
5. Adding Customisation and Designing
---

## ✅ Usage

1. Flash firmware onto ESP32-S3
2. Move the `index.html` to the SD Card
3. Connect the SD Card with the Pins to the ESP (DO IT WHILE THE POWER IS OFF)
4. Connect to WiFi AP
5. Open `192.168.4.1` in your browser
6. Upload and run scripts from the WebUI
